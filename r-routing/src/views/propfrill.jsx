                <h1>THE CHALLENGE</h1>
                <p>Being a property portal it was very important to generate queries in effective cost as well as huge in numbers. And to add brokers to propfrill to advertise on it. Although site was built with a great design but we required a landing page for each project and to draft a design which make projects to be explored with ease. Our main target, while developing a property portal, was to strike the right chord with the target audience and it was admit able that creation of such a website was not as easy as it seems. Itâ€™s not always a great idea that makes a great website. Even simplest of ideas can be used to create great websites. To do that, there was a need to consider every important aspect and inherent feature that a property portal includes.</p>
