                <h1>THE CHALLENGE</h1>
                <p>Despite being a big name in the Real Estate Industry, one of the biggest commercial projects M3M Corner walk, a pre-leased commercial property of M3M India Ltd. faced few challenges.
The ticket size of the property was very high so finding the right query was a difficult task. Moreover it was located in an isolated location on golf course extension which was also a challenge. The project was old and under construction for a long time, so it had very less search volume as the buyers were hesitant to invest on it. In total it was difficult to pick an approach which would generate results for the client.</p>
