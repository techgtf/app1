                <h1>THE CHALLENGE</h1>
                <p>Nowadays ready to move in homes are high in demand and that is the reason it is exceptionally hard to discover buyers for Under Construction Projects. Despite the fact that Supertech Limited site was all around outlined and sorted out, yet it was hard to discover offers and arrangements so it requires an alternate point of arrival for this task which would be able to co-relate with advertising creative which was live in Newspaper and Outdoor media and there should be all offers and deals with an instant query form and contact number on the landing page. Another major challenge was to make sure that the experience for website users is consistently good throughout the course of use. It was difficult to pick an alternate approach or stage such that the final product would work much better for the client.</p>
