                <h1>THE CHALLENGE</h1>
                <p>One major challenge was that ready to move in homes are high in demand and that is the reason it is exceptionally hard to discover buyers for Under Construction Projects. Despite the fact that ATSwebsite was all around outlined and sorted out, yet it was hard to discover offers and arrangements so it requires an alternate point of arrival for this task which would be able to co-relate with advertising creative which was live in Newspaper and Outdoor media and there should be all offers and deals with an instant query form and contact number on the landing page. Another challenge was that the price of this project was costlier as compared to other projects in that area. It was difficult to pick an alternate approach or stage such that the final product would work much better for the client.</p>
